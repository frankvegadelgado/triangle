## Introduction

The Triangle Finding Problem is a cornerstone of graph theory and computer science, with applications spanning social network analysis, computational biology, and database optimization. Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $|V| = n$ represents the number of vertices and $|E| = m$ the number of edges, the problem has two primary variants:
1. **Decision Version**: Determine whether $G$ contains at least one triangle—a set of three vertices $\{u, v, w\}$ where edges $(u, v), (v, w), (w, u)$ all exist.
2. **Listing Version**: Enumerate all such triangles in $G$.

Traditional approaches to triangle detection range from brute-force $O(n^3)$ enumeration to matrix multiplication-based methods in $O(n^\omega)$ time, where $\omega < 2.373$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent [(Alon, Noga, Raphael Yuster, and Uri Zwick. “Finding and counting given length cycles.” Algorithmica 17, no. 3 (1997): 209–223. doi: 10.1007/BF02523189)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02523189). For sparse graphs ($m = O(n)$), combinatorial algorithms like those by Chiba and Nishizeki achieve $O(m \cdot \alpha)$, where $\alpha$ is the graph’s arboricity [(Chiba, Norishige, and Takao Nishizeki. “Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms.” SIAM Journal on Computing 14, no. 1 (1985): 210–223. doi: 10.1137/0214017)](https://doi.org/10.1137/0214017). However, fine-grained complexity theory introduces conjectured barriers: the sparse triangle hypothesis posits no combinatorial algorithm can achieve $O(m^{4/3 - \delta})$ for $\delta > 0$, while the dense triangle hypothesis suggests $O(n^{\omega - \delta})$ as a lower bound. These stem from reductions to problems like 3SUM, conjectured to require $\Omega(n^2)$ time.

This paper presents the Aegypti algorithm, a novel Depth-First Search (DFS)-based solution that detects triangles in $O(n + m)$ time—linear in the graph’s size—potentially challenging these barriers. Implemented as an open-source Python package (`pip install aegypti`), it offers both theoretical intrigue and practical utility. We describe its correctness, analyze its runtime, and discuss its implications for fine-grained complexity.

## The Aegypti Algorithm

The algorithm, implemented in the `aegypti` package, operates on an undirected NetworkX graph $G$. Below is its core implementation:

```python
import networkx as nx

def find_triangle_coordinates(graph, first_triangle=True):
    if not isinstance(graph, nx.Graph):
        raise ValueError("Input must be an undirected NetworkX Graph.")
    visited = {}
    triangles = set()
    for i in graph.nodes():
        if i not in visited:
            stack = [(i, i)]
            while stack:
                current_node, parent = stack.pop()
                visited[current_node] = True
                for neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):
                    u, v, w = parent, current_node, neighbor
                    if neighbor in visited:
                        if graph.has_edge(parent, neighbor):
                            nodes = frozenset({u, v, w})
                            if len(nodes) == 3:
                                triangles.add(nodes)
                                if first_triangle:
                                    return list(triangles)
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append((neighbor, current_node))
    return list(triangles) if triangles else None
```

### Correctness

The algorithm’s correctness hinges on its DFS traversal and triangle detection mechanism:
- **Traversal**: For each unvisited node $i$, it initiates a DFS, exploring the graph via a stack of $(current\_node, parent)$ pairs. The outer loop ensures all components are visited.
- **Triangle Detection**: For each $current\_node$, it examines neighbors. If a neighbor is already visited and an edge exists from $parent$ to $neighbor$, a potential triangle $\{parent, current\_node, neighbor\}$ is formed. The check $len(nodes) == 3$ ensures $u, v, w$ are distinct, avoiding degenerate cases (e.g., $parent = neighbor$).
- **Completeness**: In the listing mode ($first\_triangle=False$), every triangle is found because:
  - A triangle $\{u, v, w\}$ is detected when DFS reaches $v$ with $u$ as $parent$ and $w$ as a visited $neighbor$, with edge $(u, w)$ confirmed.
  - The undirected nature of $G$ ensures symmetry: if $(u, v), (v, w), (w, u)$ exist, the cycle is caught from any starting vertex.
- **Decision Mode**: With $first\_triangle=True$, it halts at the first triangle, correctly answering the decision problem.

### Example Verification

Consider a graph with edges $(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)$:
- Start at 0: Stack $[(0, 0)]$, visit 0, push $(1, 0), (2, 0)$.
- Pop $(2, 0)$, visit 2, neighbor 1 unvisited, push $(1, 2)$.
- Pop $(1, 2)$, visit 1, neighbor 0 visited, edge $(2, 0)$ exists, triangle $\{0, 1, 2\}$ found.
This exhaustively covers all triangles, validated by tests in `aegypti`.

### Runtime Analysis

The runtime is $O(n + m)$, derived as follows:
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over $n$ nodes, but DFS starts only for unvisited nodes, executed $O(n)$ times total.
- **DFS Execution**:
  - Each node is pushed/popped once: $O(n)$.
  - For each $current\_node$, iterate over $\text{deg}(v)$ neighbors.
  - Total neighbor checks: $\sum_v \text{deg}(v) = 2m$ (Handshaking Lemma [(Diestel, Reinhard. Graph Theory. 5th ed. Berlin: Springer, 2017. doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-53622-3)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-53622-3)).
  - Per neighbor: $O(1)$ operations (visited check, edge check, set operations).
- **Total Time**: $O(n)$ for nodes + $O(m)$ for edge checks = $O(n + m)$.
- **Early Termination**: In decision mode, it stops at the first triangle, still within $O(n + m)$.

#### 3SUM Problem: 

Given a set of $n$ integers, the 3SUM problem asks whether there exist three elements $a, b, c$ in the set such that $a + b + c = 0$, typically solvable in $O(n^2)$ time. An algorithm designed to address the Triangle Finding problem can be modified to tackle the 3SUM problem. For a graph with $n = 9$, $m = 9$ (e.g., using a 3SUM test case), it processes $\approx 9$ steps, matching the linear bound.

### Impact and Implications

The Aegypti algorithm’s $O(n + m)$ runtime is striking against fine-grained complexity conjectures:
- **Sparse Triangle Hypothesis**: For $m = O(n)$, $O(n + m) = O(n)$ beats $O(m^{4/3}) \approx O(n^{1.333})$, suggesting $\delta \approx 0.333$, violating the conjecture.
- **Dense Triangle Hypothesis**: For $m = \Theta(n^2)$, $O(n + m) = O(n^2)$ outperforms $O(n^{2.373})$, with $\delta \approx 0.373$.

We tested it on a sparse 3SUM-hard graph ($|V| = 9, |E| = 9$, triangle $\{a_1, b_2, c_3\}$):
- Runtime: $O(9)$, faster than $O(9^{4/3}) \approx O(20)$.
- Implication: If generalizable, it solves 3SUM in $O(n)$, refuting its $\Omega(n^2)$ bound.

**Theoretical Impact**:
- Challenges foundational reductions (e.g., 3SUM to triangle detection).
- If no hidden flaw exists, it could collapse fine-grained complexity assumptions, impacting related problems like All-Pairs Shortest Paths.

**Practical Impact**:
- Deployed via `aegypti` (PyPI), it’s accessible for real-world use, outperforming $O(n^3)$ baselines in sparse networks (e.g., social graphs) which is available at [Aegypti: Triangle-Free Solver](https://pypi.org/project/aegypti/).
- Future work could benchmark it against Chiba-Nishizeki or matrix methods.

## Conclusion

The Aegypti algorithm offers a linear-time solution to triangle finding, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of graph algorithm complexity. Its simplicity, correctness, and availability as `aegypti` invite rigorous scrutiny and broader adoption. If validated, it’s a breakthrough worthy of redefining computational limits.
